/**
 * TWI flags explained:
 *
 * TWINT: TWI Interrupt Flag. It is set when the TWI finishes ANY bus operation and has to cleared (by writing a 1 to it) before a new operation can be started.
 * TWEA: TWI Enable Acknowledge; When the device receives data (as slave or as master), this bit has to be set if the next incoming byte should be ACKed and cleared for a NACK.
 * TWSTA: TWI Start; When a master has to generate a start condition, write this bit 1 together with TWEN and TWINT. The TWI hardware will generate a start condition and return the appropriate status code.
 * TWSTO: TWI Stop; Similar to TWSTA, but generates a Stop condition on the bus. TWINT is not set after generating a Stop condition.
 * TWWC: TWI Write Collision; Set by the TWI hardware when writing to the TWI Data Register TWDR while TWINT is high.
 * TWEN: Any bus operation only takes place when TWEN is written to 1 when accessing TWCR.
 * TWIE: TWI Interrupt Enable; If this bit is set, the CPU will jump to the TWI reset vector when a TWI interrupt occurs.
